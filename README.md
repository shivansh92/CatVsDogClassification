# CatVsDogClassification

I used Kaggle dataset of Cats and Dogs. It includes 25000 labelled images of cats and dogs for training and validation. It has 12500 dataset for testing the Network. 

Network Architecture: The network has 9 layers including 3 convolutional layers. I am conidering Dropout as a layer. The training runs for 30 epochs.
